# Kumar-Sanni-Sinha--Drag---Drop-
Now, to run and test the drag and drop solution:

1. Open the GitHub repository page for your project.
2. Click on the "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to download a ZIP archive of the repository, or copy the repository URL and clone it using Git on your local machine.
3. Extract the contents of the ZIP archive if you downloaded it.
4. Navigate to the repository folder on your local machine.
5. Locate the index.html file.
6. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
7. You should see a page with two containers: the left container with a list of draggable items and the right container initially empty.
8. Test the drag and drop functionality by dragging a list item from the left container and dropping it into the right container. The item should move to the right container,
   and its background color should change to red.
9. Verify that the success message appears at the top of the page, indicating a successful drop.
10. Click the "Reset" button and confirm that the right container is cleared, and a message briefly appears indicating that the items have been reset.
    Repeat the drag and drop process to test it again.
11. By following these steps, you should be able to run and test the drag and drop functionality locally and create a README file on GitHub to provide instructions and information 
    about your project.
